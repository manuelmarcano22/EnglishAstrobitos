## Hercules X-1 


Hercules, the divine hero son of Jupyter and Alcmene gives the name to one of the largest and easily to recognized  constellation of the northern sky. This constellation is easily recognized by the star pattern called the Keystone, representing Hercules torso as he stands victoriously on Draco's head. A perfect name for a constellation that holds one of the most studied, yet intriguing, powerful X-ray source in our galaxy. Hercules constellation is home to the X-ray binary rightly called, Hercules X-1 (Her X-1). Her X-1 is one of the X-ray sources discover by the first X-ray satellite mission launched, Uhuru. It was discovered in 1971, but in spite of being one of the longest known and most studied X-ray sources, Hercules X-1 continues to intrigue astronomers.


Her X-1 belongs to a special class of X-ray binaries called Intermediate-mass X-ray binaries. In all X-ray binaries a neutron star ( or a black hole) accreates mass from its main sequence star binary companion. Depending on the mass of the companion star, X-ray binaries are classified into three categories: Low-mass X-ray binaries ( if the companion star is less massive than our Sun), intermediate-mass X-ray binaries, and High-mass X-ray binaries (if the companion has at least 10 times the mass of our Sun). In the case of Her X-1 a 1.4 solar mass neutron star is accreating from a 2.2 solar mass main sequence star, making Her X-1 part of the rare intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXRBs). Interesting enough, Her X-1 is an IMXRB but combines characteristic of both Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and High Mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). For example, like most LMXBs, Her X-1 is thought to accreate matter via Roche Lobe overflow (see image below). In HMXBs the accreation tends to happen via stellar wind from the massive stellar companion. But similar to HMXBs, Her X-1 has a very strong magnetic fields ($10^{12}$ G), and a very low spin (the neutron star is spinning with a period of 1.24s), in LMBXs the neutron stars tend to have weak magnetic field ($<10^9$ G) and typically have spin periods of milliseconds.

### X-ray is only part of the story

These X-ray binaries are not only luminous in the X-ray, but they also emitted in other wavelength including the radio (this radio radiation being indicative of a jet or another type of outflow). The current model is that as mass transfer changes in the system, the X-ray binary passes from a so called hard state to a soft state. In the hard state the accreation disk is truncated and the X-rays originated in the truncated accretion disk get energized via interaction (inverse Compton scattering ) with a surrounding gas of hot electron called a corona. In this state, radio emission is often detected and is associated with a jet from the compact object. As the X-ray luminosity increases, the inner accreation disk moves inward closer to the compact object; the corona gets colder and now the radiation is dominated by the X-rays emitted from the hot inner region of the accreation disk. As the transition to this soft state is made the steady jet is quenched appearing again in the reverse transition back to the hard state. 



Since LMXBs with black hole are radio brighter at a given X-ray luminosity, this process is better understood for systems with black holes, but the same is seem for some LMXBs with neutron stars. In fact, the presence of radio emission and the inferred jets represent another observational difference between HMXRBs and LMXRBs. In LMXRBs the X-ray emission and the radio luminosity seem to be correlated similar to accreting black holes. This systematic difference between the presence of jets in LMXBs and HMXRBs is still to be understood and probable the spin period, and the value of magnetic field play an important role. Only more multiwavelenght observation in X-ray and radio will help to better understand which properties of the neutron star LMXBs and the neutron star HMXBs could explain this apparent systematic difference. Her X-1, sharing properties of both LMXRBs and HMXRBs, is the perfect target to tried to understand better this jet formation mechanics and disk/jet coupling. This is exactly the authors of today's paper tried to do. The authors of today paper present the result from multiwavelength observation in radio and X-ray of Her X-1.

Array (VLA). The VLA observation is shown by the dasked line. Notice the variability on the X-ray curve. This variability is geometric due to a precessing warped accreation disk.

For the first time the authors present the discovery of radio emission from Her X-1. A jet is no the only physical mechanism, but a synchrotron emission for a steady jets is consistent with the observed radio properties. The authors go methodically through other physical mechanics (e.g. stellar wind, magnetic shocks) that could account for the radio emission, but found these to be unlikely. 

As stated above, Her X-1 also shares characteristics with many of the neutron star HMXBs: a strong magnetic field ($> 10^{12}$ G) and a slow spin, but radio detections of HMXBs are relatively rare. The presence of a jet in Her X-1 automatically implies that a strong magnetic field and a slow spin do not completely impede jet formation. If new radio observation indeed confirms the jet nature of the radio emission in Her X-1, the current understating of jet formation in the presence of a strong neutron star magnetic field, needs to be revised. For example, the above scenario of jet quenching described for black holes is hard to reconcile when strong stellar magnetic field are present, as the strong magnetic field would prevent the disk moving inwards. New scenarios of jet formation need to be explored and the detection of radio emission from Her X-1 opens the possibility to detect jets in other undetected sources. So stay tuned as more multiwavelenght observation of this intriguing powerful system could shed new light about the still obscure physical mechanics underlying jet formation and jet-disc coupling.
